# Antigravity Auto Accept

Antigravity Auto Accept is a lightweight extension for auto-accepting Antigravity approval prompts, terminal run confirmations, and common agent continue/allow actions.

It includes a control panel for CDP status, launcher generation, and runtime state so users can configure Antigravity cleanly instead of fighting repeated approval clicks.

Supported workflow today:

- Antigravity IDE 1.x and 2.x approval prompts
- terminal run approvals
- CDP launcher setup and control panel flow
- Antigravity, Cursor, and VS Code environments

> **Note:** This extension works with the VS Code-based **Antigravity IDE** (both 1.x and 2.x). The standalone **Antigravity 2.0 desktop app** uses a different architecture and is not supported by this extension.

## Support

This extension is free. I have spent a lot of time building it, maintaining it, and fixing it again after upstream changes and updates. If it saves you time and you want to support the project, you can buy me a coffee:

Even a very small coffee donation helps me sustain the plugin, keep spending time on fixes, and keep it free.

## Current Release

Current version:

- `1.3.0`

Download:

- GitHub release page:
  https://github.com/pesoszpesosz/antigravity-auto-accept/releases
- Open VSX:
  https://open-vsx.org/extension/pesosz/antigravity-auto-accept/

## Open The Control Panel First

This should be the first thing users look for after installation.

Where to find it:

- look at the bottom-right status area of the IDE
- on Antigravity, this is on the right side below the chat area
- find the status item with the tools icon and label `Auto Accept Panel`
- click it to open the control panel

You can also open it from the command palette:

- `Antigravity Auto Accept: Open Control Panel`

What users should do there:

1. confirm the expected CDP port
2. save the port if they want a different one
3. if Antigravity is not installed in a default location, click `Choose IDE Path...`
4. click `Save IDE Launcher...`
5. save the launcher wherever they want
6. always open Antigravity through that launcher when they want that CDP port

## What It Does

- Auto-accepts common Antigravity approval actions.
- Shows the current CDP state in a dedicated control panel.
- Lets users choose the CDP port instead of hard-coding one path.
- Saves a launcher file anywhere on the machine.
- Provides exact open steps plus a manual fallback command.
- Supports background mode when CDP is available.

## How It Works

1. The extension runs locally in the UI extension host.
2. It tracks the current IDE, platform, expected CDP port, active CDP ports, and live CDP connections.
3. The user opens the control panel and chooses the desired CDP port.
4. The user saves a platform-specific launcher file.
5. That launcher starts the IDE with `--remote-debugging-port=<port>`.
6. Once CDP is active, the extension can handle approvals more reliably and expose a cleaner runtime state.

## Control Panel

The control panel is the center of the current workflow.

It shows:

- extension version
- IDE
- platform
- remote context
- extension host
- expected CDP port
- active CDP ports
- active CDP connections
- support guidance with next step
- support health checklist
- recent activity counters
- saved launcher path
- exact manual launch command

It also lets the user:

- save the selected CDP port
- save an IDE launcher anywhere
- toggle Auto Accept
- toggle Background Mode
- copy diagnostics for support
- copy a full support bundle
- open the output log directly
- copy launcher steps
- copy the manual launch command
- show recent activity stats in the panel
- pause behavior on CDP mismatch

## Launcher Flow

The launcher flow replaced the older disruptive setup path.

The current behavior is:

1. Choose a CDP port in the control panel.
2. Click `Save IDE Launcher...`.
3. Save the file wherever you want.
4. Open the IDE through that saved file whenever you want the selected CDP port.

Generated launcher format by platform:

- Windows: `.lnk`
- macOS: `.command`
- Linux: `.sh`

The panel also shows:

- the saved launcher path
- step-by-step open instructions
- a manual fallback command if you want to launch it yourself

## What Changed In This Fix Cycle

- Replaced noisy startup setup prompting with a dedicated control panel flow.
- Added a persistent bottom-right status entry for opening the panel.
- Added configurable CDP port management.
- Replaced desktop-only assumptions with a save-anywhere launcher flow.
- Simplified the panel so it focuses on the actions users actually need.
- Improved runtime status reporting for expected port, active ports, and connections.
- Added clearer manual instructions directly in the UI.
- Fixed Windows launcher generation so it follows the working shortcut shape already used by Antigravity on this machine.
- Reduced prompt flooding and mismatched setup states.

## Platform Status

Current factual status:

- Windows: validated in the current fix cycle.
- macOS: launcher generation is implemented with `.command` output.
- Linux: launcher generation is implemented with `.sh` output.

Windows has been verified end-to-end in the current fix cycle. The macOS and Linux launcher paths are implemented in the extension and documented, but they should still be validated on native hosts before calling them equally proven in every environment.

## Quick Start

1. Install the extension from Open VSX or from a VSIX.
2. Open the bottom-right `Auto Accept Panel` status item.
3. Set the CDP port you want.
4. Click `Save IDE Launcher...`.
5. Save the launcher wherever you want on your machine.
6. Open Antigravity through that saved launcher.
7. Turn on `Auto Accept`.

## Manual Fallback Commands

### Windows

```powershell
$exeCandidates = @(
  "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Antigravity\Antigravity.exe",
  "$env:ProgramFiles\Antigravity\Antigravity.exe",
  "$env:ProgramFiles(x86)\Antigravity\Antigravity.exe"
)
$exe = $exeCandidates | Where-Object { Test-Path $_ } | Select-Object -First 1
if (-not $exe) { Write-Host 'Antigravity executable not found'; exit 1 }
Start-Process $exe -ArgumentList '--remote-debugging-port=9000'
```

### macOS

```bash
# Antigravity IDE 2.x
